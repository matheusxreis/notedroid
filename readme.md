### About

The first app that I really made using kotlin to android was a note app. In that epoch, I didn't know how to do the things yet.
This app is a better version of that app. Using new things I know and improve what possible.

### What was used to build it

- **MVVM**: the model-view-viewmodel architecture;
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: to deal with async called.
- **Single Activity**: one activity, multiple fragments;
- **Navigation component**: to make a stack navigation between fragments;
- **Data Binding**: to bind ui components in my layouts;
- **Datastore**: to save user preferences;
- **Room**: to save the user notes;
- **Hilt**: to inject the dependencies.
